    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why we're interested in the topic\n",
    "Smoking becomes a common phenomenon among teenagers even though they know the negative effects of it. The prevalence of tobacco products makes it both more tempting to try and harder to quit for teenagers (Burton et al.). Scholars studying student smoking rates in ON (Reitsma and Manske) and BC (Johnson et al.) claim that the issue needs more attention as it causes severe health problems. Hence, our research analyses the problem by finding the **difference between the proportions of high-school regular smokers in British Columbia and Ontario**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our data set\n",
    "We use the data obtained from a biennial school-based Health Canada's survey constructed in 2018/2019 that the studies smoking rates among Canadian students (Canada and Impact).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "The variables we choose are aimed at defining our custom variable that determines whether a data set observation is a high-school student who is a regular smoker.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable   \t| Value   \t| Meaning                                                 \t|\n",
    "|------------\t|---------\t|---------------------------------------------------------\t|\n",
    "| **GRADE**  \t| [9, 12] \t| student is from a grade 9-12                            \t|\n",
    "| **DVRES**  \t| 1 or 3  \t| resident of Canada or has lived in Canada for 11+ years \t|\n",
    "| **TS_011** \t| 1 or 2  \t| will smoke a cigarette within next year                 \t|\n",
    "| **TV_010** \t| 1 or 2  \t| will use an e-cigarette within next year                \t|\n",
    "| **SS_040** \t| 1       \t| has smoked 100+ cigarettes                              \t|\n",
    "| **SS_060** \t| 7 or 8  \t| has smoked 20-30 cigarettes during the last 30 days     \t|\n",
